# Cover-Letter-Fill-in-the-Blank-and-DataFrame
for anyone like me who has cookie cutter cover letters and doesn't want to spend time filling in the blanks and keeping track of where they've applied.

This project takes strings of cover letters, asks for user inputs of the position and company names, and then fills this information in, along with the date, to the cover letter of choice and creates a pdf file within the current directory. There is a jupyter notebook version and a regular python file, both are the same

The position, company, and date are put into a SQLite database and stored in your current working directory

Let's get this bread!
